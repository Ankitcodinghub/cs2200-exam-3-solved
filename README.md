Sanskriti‚Äôs pipelined processor features separate instruction and data caches. The instruction cache (I-cache) has a single level and the data cache (D-cache) has three levels, as shown in the following diagram.

I-Cache L1 D-Cache L1 D-Cache L2 D-Cache L3

Hit Ratio 97% 88% 75% 72%

Access Time 4 cycles 4 cycles 14 cycles 24 cycles

Block Size 1 word 1 word 1 word 1 word

‚óè The processor achieves an average CPI of 1.2, without accounting for memory stalls.

‚óè Memory accesses (LWs and SWs) account for 25% of all the instructions executed.

‚óè Out of these memory accesses, 65% are reads and 35% are writes.

‚óè On a cache miss, the CPU experiences a latency of 120 cycles to read from memory, and a latency of 7 cycles to write to memory.

‚óè All caches use the write-through and write-allocate policies.

‚óè There is no write-buffer in the datapath between the CPU and memory bus, hence the CPU must stall until each write reaches memory.

For each of the following questions (1.1 to 1.9), show your work to receive credit. Round your final answers to 2 decimal places. For EMAT calculations, give your answer in terms of CPU cycles.

Q1.1 (1 points)

What percentage of all instructions are loads? What percentage of all instructions are stores?

Q1.2 (2 points)

Q1.7 (1 point)

Q1.8 (2 points)

Q1.9 (3 points)

Consider a memory system with 24-bit virtual addresses, 20-bit physical memory addresses, and a page size of 2048 B. Calculate the following for questions 2.1 ‚Äì 2.4.

Q2.5 (2 points)

A standard page size for virtual memory is 4 KB, but some systems support page sizes of 2 MB or larger. How does the page size affect the frequency of page faults in a virtual memory system? Explain your answer.

Q2.6 (2 points)

How does the page size affect internal fragmentation? Explain your answer.

Question 3 (4 points)

Kaylia notices the following virtual page accesses are recorded for three independent processes P1, P2, and P3 respectively over a time interval.

P1: 0, 1, 0, 21, 1, 1, 4, 0, 0

P2: 91, 62, 1, 65, 55, 55, 62, 1, 91, 91, 62 P3: 45, 10, 3, 3, 5, 7, 28, 5

What is the cumulative memory pressure on the system during this time interval?

Q4.1 (6 points)

Consider a direct-mapped cache with 5 sets. Sets are indexed from 0 to 4. The cache block size is a word. Assume that the cache is initially empty and that each memory access operates at word granularity (i.e., all addresses are word addresses).

Q4.2 (6 points)

Now, consider a 3-way set associative cache with 3 sets. The cache uses an LRU replacement policy. Sets are indexed from 0 to 2 and ways are numbered from 0 to 2. The cache block size is a word. Assume that the cache is initially empty and that each memory access operates at word granularity (i.e., all addresses are word addresses). If the cache set is empty, use cache way 0.

c) For the memory accesses shown below starting from an empty cache, fill in the rows. If there is a miss, please specify the type of miss in the table. (3 points total)

Q5.1 (3 points)

Nityam decides to design the cache with 256 sets and 16B cache blocks. What are some drawbacks of his design?

Q5.2 (3 points)

Ayush decides to design the cache with 256 ways and 16B cache blocks. What is another name for Ayush‚Äôs cache design? Why might it not perform as well as Nityam‚Äôs design?

Q5.3 (4 points)

Kaylia designs a direct mapped cache, but with 256B cache blocks. What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of this design compared to Nityam‚Äôs cache?

(11 points)

Prasad is an intern at Intel. His job is designing a 4-way set-associative cache with the following characteristics:

‚óè Total cache capacity = 128 KB (1KB = 1024 bytes).

‚óè CPU uses 64-bit byte-addressable memory addresses.

‚óè The cache block size is 64 bytes.

‚óè The cache has one valid bit per cache block.

‚óè The cache uses a write-back policy and uses one dirty bit per 8-byte word to minimize the amount of data that must be written back when an eviction occurs.

‚óè The cache‚Äôs replacement policy guarantees that the two most-recently used cache blocks will not be evicted. The MRU fields uniquely identify the two most recently used cache blocks in that cache set. For replacement, one of the remaining 6 ways is chosen at random.

However, Prasad never took CS 2200 and is thus completely lost! Help him by answering some questions to design the cache.

Q6.1 (2 points)

How many sets are in the cache?

Q6.2 (3 points)

How many bits are needed for the following (1 pt each):

a) Block Offset

b) Index

c) Tag

Q6.3 (2 points)

How many dirty bits are needed per cache block?

Q6.4 (2 points)

How many MRU bits are needed per set?

Q6.5 (2 points)

How many bits are required in total for metadata storage (including MRU)? You don‚Äôt need to compute the final sum.

Consider a paged memory system with 5 physical frames that the OS has reserved strictly for housing application pages.

Figure 1 shows a timeline of virtual page accesses with associated timestamps. For example, at timestamp 2, virtual page 10 is accessed.

The memory system has a hardware component in the CPU called the Tracker. The Tracker records the access order of all the pages currently in memory. That is, entry 1 holds the most recently accessed page, entry 2 holds the second most recently accessed page, and the last entry holds the least recently accessed page.

Figure 2 shows the contents of the Tracker at timestamp 5. Its contents are [4, 3, 7, 10, 1]. The first entry in the Tracker is the most recently accessed page: page 4. The Tracker is accessible to the memory management system in the OS.

Q7.1 (2 points)

Explain how the operating system can use the Tracker component to make page replacement decisions.

Q7.2 (2 points)

What are the contents of the Tracker at timestamp 9?

Q7.3 (3 points)

How many total page faults occur in total in this scenario of 9 page accesses. Assume that none of the pages are in physical memory in the beginning. Show your work for credit.

Q7.3 (2 points)

Would implementing a Tracker component be feasible for a memory system with thousands of physical frames? Explain why or why not.
